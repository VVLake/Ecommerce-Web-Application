# ðŸ›’ E-Commerce Store with React, Redux Toolkit & FakeStoreAPI

## Overview
This project is a React-based e-commerce application that showcases a product catalog, category filtering, a shopping cart with Redux Toolkit state management, and a checkout feature. It integrates with the FakeStoreAPI for product data.

## ðŸš€ Features

### Product Catalog
- Uses React Query to fetch all products from FakeStoreAPI.
- Displays product title, price, category, description, rating, and image.
- Each product includes an "Add to Cart" button.

### Category Navigation
- Dynamically fetches product categories from FakeStoreAPI.
- Provides a dropdown to filter products by selected category.

### Shopping Cart
- Uses Redux Toolkit to manage cart state: adding, updating quantity, and removing products.
- Displays cart items with title, image, quantity, and price.
- Allows quantity adjustment directly in the cart.
- Removes items individually or clears the entire cart.
- Persists cart state in sessionStorage across sessions.

### Checkout Functionality
